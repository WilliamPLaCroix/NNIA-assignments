    "* Assignments are to be submitted in a **team of 2-3**. It is fine to submit first **2** assignments without a team, but starting from the **3rd** assignment it is not allowed.\n",
    "* Please include your **names**, **ID's**, **CMS usernames**, and **approximate total time spent per person** at the beginning of the Notebook in the space provided\n",
    "* Make sure you appropriately comment your code wherever required.\n",
    "* Do **not** submit any data or cache files (e.g. `__pycache__`).\n",
    "* Upload the **zipped** folder (`.zip` is the only accepted extension) in **CMS**.\n",
    "* Only **one** member of the group should make the submission.\n",
    "* **Important** please name the submitted zip folder as: `Name1_id1_Name2_id2(_Name3_id3).zip`. The Jupyter Notebook should also be named: `Name1_id1_Name2_id2.ipynb`. This is **very important** for our internal organization repeatedly students fail to do this.\n",

    "In this exercise you will construct your first neural network using PyTorch. You are provided with a dataset (with train dev spilt) describing the beer consumption for each day for one year in university area of São Paulo, Brazil. The data has 5 features (mean-, min-, max-temperature of the day, precipitation and if it was the weekend) and one target (amount of beer consumed). Your task is to build a neural network to predict the daily beer consumption based on the given features.\n",

    "2. Build a neural network using Pytorch. It should consist of two linear layers with a hidden dimensionality of 32 and ReLU after the first linear layer. For this use [nn.linear](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) and [nn.ReLU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html). As the loss function use [nn.MSELoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MSELoss.html) and use stochastic gradient descent ([torch.optim.SGD](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html)) to optimize based on the loss function.\n",
